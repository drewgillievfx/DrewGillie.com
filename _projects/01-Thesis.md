Comprehensive comparison of integrating 3D and live action elements. Using Nuke
and Maya to compare several different methods for creating a visual effect shot
in a motion picture. Chrome ball used on set to capture lighting information. 3D
environment created and composited into real footage. Photo spheres created. 3D
model created in Maya, and from photos into 3D mesh ACES workflow used to
preserve color information for a better composite. Find the limitations of how
far each method can be pushed before the shot starts to look unreal.
