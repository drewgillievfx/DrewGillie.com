# Drew’s guide for buying Televisions

	LCD - Liquid crystal display
	Benefits
	Good blacks and whites
	Less of a delay if you like gaming and are sensitive to lag
	Disadvantages
	Terrible viewing angle – it wont look best off axis like 40-degrees away
	Not good color reproduction
	Room lighting can be a problem
	Cannot see if wearing polarized sunglasses
	LED - Light emitting diode
	Benefits
	More light power per watt
	good color reproduction
	Last longer
	Can take a beating if dropped
	Good viewing angle
	Disadvantages
	In room lighting affects it, but handles it the best out of the 3 choices
	Not the best for blacks and whites…………(colors…..of pixels..)

	OLED-organic light emmiting diode
	Benefits
	No backlighting-means true blacks
	Higher contrast ratio
	Large viewing angle

	Disadvantages
	Lifespan-colors die after roughly 5 years
	Blue degrades faster than other colors
	Consumes more power

	Plasma –plasma
	Benefits
	Amazing color reproduction
	True blacks
	Disadvantages
	Glass screen
	Can shatter if not careful
	Glossy surface and will reflect room lighting if it is on
	‘screen burn’
	They have gotten much better at fixing this
	Software to fix if it does happen
	As long as you don’t watch 4 x 3 or leave your tv on pause for 16 hours you will be fine
	Tv will shut off if it recognizes a pause screen on for more than ten minutes

	Summary of four technologies
	OLED and Plasma is best, followed by LED, then LCD
	Price wise – cheapest is LCD, then LED then Plasma, then OLED
	Plasma is cheap until it gets to about 50 inches
	All in all LED is probably the best choice
 
	Features common in TV’s
	Refresh rate
	60 hz
	Not many tvs are 60 hz
	This is the minimum necessary for TV’s
	120 hz
	Most Tv’s have this
	In my opinion this is the best option, unless it is 4K
	240 hz
	Good for 4k, it needs it
	Good for 3D
	Bad for not 4k
	Also bad because most movies and television shows only shoot at max 60 frames per second
	If the movie is shot with higher refresh rate…Hobbit (48 fps) will look good
	All other movies look horrible and kinda look like a soap opera
	ANYTHING ANIMATED LOOKS TERRIBLE WITH 240 REFRESH RATE
	It looks like you are watching the movie before it’s final texture layer is applied
	Because of this many things involving CG also look terrible because of how CG is exported
	Things not filmed in higher fps will be blurred when displayed
	****some tv’s have the option to switch refresh rate if 240hz is advertised
	Resolution
	720
	Good for displays smaller than 30 inches viewed at normal couch distance
	1080
	Good for most TVs
	When size of tv is more than 40 inches, it depends on viewing distance
	Most things are exported in 1080
	4K
	Good for anything bigger than 45 inches
	Not much media is in 4K now, however it will slowly get there
	Requires smart TV incorporated into it because of up sampling 1080
	Any cable tv will most likely look terrible. Unless it is DTV or HBO
	Expensive
 
	Price average
	About $1200
	60 in TV’s
	Some 1080
	Some 4K
