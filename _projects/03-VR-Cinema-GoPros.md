RIT Motion Picture Science students create a fictional "behind-the-scenes"
experience to show off their homemade virtual reality camera and display
system. Shown here is the flattened 360-degree virtual canvas from the final
film. To watch the demo go to

The first year working on this project, I focused on sound. From the beginning
our goal was to create 3D surround audio to go with the 360-degree video. I
learned enough Unity to get by and start creating sounds localized in an
environment. In the end we stuck with stereo due to some software issues.

The second year working on this project the focus was to get our own Oculus and
work on the stitching in Kolor.
