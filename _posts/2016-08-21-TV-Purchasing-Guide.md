1. First title
2. second item
⋅⋅* sub second.
3. third title
⋅⋅1. 3 sub
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses




# *LCD* - Liquid crystal display

	*Benefits*

    -Good blacks and whites
    -Less of a delay if you like gaming and are sensitive to lag

	*Disadvantages*

    -Terrible viewing angle – it wont look best off axis like 40-degrees away
    -Not good color reproduction
    -Room lighting can be a problem
    -Cannot see if wearing polarized sunglasses



## *LED* - Light emitting diode

	*Benefits*

    -More light power per watt
    -good color reproduction
    -Last longer
    -Can take a beating if dropped
    -Good viewing angle

	*Disadvantages*

    -In room lighting will affect it, but handles it the best out of the 3
    choices
    -Not the best for black and white pixels


### *OLED*-organic light emmiting diode

	*Benefits*

    -No backlighting-means true blacks
    -Higher contrast ratio
    -Large viewing angle

	*Disadvantages*

    -Lifespan-colors die after roughly 5 years
    -Blue degrades faster than other colors
    -Consumes more power


#### *Plasma* –plasma

	*Benefits*

    -Amazing color reproduction
    -True black colors

	*Disadvantages*

	 -Glass screen, highly reflective
   -Can shatter if not careful
   -Glossy surface and will reflect room lighting if it is on ‘screen burn’
   -They have gotten much better at fixing this
   -Software to fix a burned image if it does happen
   -As long as you don’t watch 4 x 3 or leave your tv on pause for 16 hours you
   will be fine
   -Tv will shut off if it recognizes a pause screen on for more than ten
   minutes


##### Summary of four technologies

	**OLED** and *Plasma* are the best, followed by LED, then LCD
	Price wise – cheapest is LCD, then LED then Plasma, then OLED
	Plasma is cheap until it gets to about 50 inches
	All in all LED is probably the best choice

 
###### Features common in TV’s

	Refresh rate
		60 hz
      Not many tvs are 60 hz
			This is the minimum necessary for TV’s
		120 hz
			Most Tv’s have this
			In my opinion this is the best option, unless it is 4K
		240 hz
			Good for 4k, it needs it
			Good for 3D
			Bad for not 4k
			Also bad because most movies and television shows only shoot at max
			60 frames per second.	If the movie is shot with higher refresh
			rate…Hobbit (48 fps) will look good.	All other movies look horrible and
			kind of look like a soap opera.
			ANYTHING ANIMATED LOOKS TERRIBLE WITH 240 REFRESH RATE
			It looks like you are watching the movie before it’s final texture layer
			is applied. Because of this many things involving CG also look terrible
			because of how CG is exported. Things not filmed in higher fps will be
			blurred when displayed.

	****some tv’s have the option to switch refresh rate if 240hz is advertised


###### Resolution
_720_
Good for displays smaller than 30 inches viewed at normal couch distance
_1080_
Good for most TVs
When size of tv is more than 40 inches, it depends on viewing distance
Most things are exported in 1080
_4K_
Good for anything bigger than 45 inches
Not much media is in 4K now, however it will slowly get there.
Requires smart TV incorporated into it because of up sampling 1080
Any cable tv will most likely look terrible. Unless it is DTV or HBO
Expensive
