As the visual effects supervisor for this project, I chose for our group to
compare several things between the cameras. The first thing I wanted to test was
how each camera would key on a blue screen and a green screen, then compare the
results. The next thing I wanted to test, was how good each camera could pull a
key with difficult items on the green screen. We chose a net, a see through
shower curtain, and a comb-mobile to be our high frequency content. The Third
thing I wanted to test for was how color would be affected through the keying
process. A Macbeth chart was placed on the green screen set. Lastly I wanted to
test the tracking ability of the two camera systems. Tennis ball trackers were
made and thrown around the set while the camera moved all around. Some
stationary tennis balls were placed in the scene as well. This scene was then
tracked in 2D and 3D to see how well each camera would track.
