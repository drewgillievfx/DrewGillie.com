You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and
re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many
different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches
 a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the
convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front
matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it
works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at
[Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on
[Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

NAB 2016 day 1
High Dynamic Range in Animation

The Panel consists of 2 people who worked on Zootopia and 3 people who worked on
Inside Out. One of the issues with HDR in Animation is that there are very few
devices that can actually display HDR imagery. The display that Pixar is using
is the Pulsar from Dolby, which is a $30,000 display. You can see where this presents an issue in a production company. Pixar only has 1 HDR display, and as
they were saying there might be some better creative decisions made if all
departments had a reference HDR display to use. They could see the changes right
there without exporting to the reference display.

Another part of their process was to export an HDR version and a version where they would stop down by 3 stops to see where the difference was and how
noticeable it would be.

HDR for the home is a difficult transition and currently there is no plan to
send it out anytime soon.


High Dynamic Range in Live Action and Visual effects
No real adjustment because VFX works natively with .exr files. VFX strives to
get the most raw data from on set.

Pipeline speed and efficiency is a huge factor into mastering to HDR and really
anything new introduced to the industry.HDR monitoring during the creating
process is important to get greater details. Especially when creating models
in the texturing process. Current process is checking in parallel for quality
check on a HDR display to make sure no values are not clipped.
