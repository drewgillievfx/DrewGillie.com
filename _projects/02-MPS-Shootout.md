Technical analysis between the Arri D-21 and the Arriflex BL-III using Vision 3
500T Film to explore critical image quality. Produced and planned the shootout.
Compared the tracking ability, and blue and green screens between each camera
system. On set visual effects supervisor to ensure that the green screen scenes
were properly recorded and lit. Used Nuke in the ACES workflow.
